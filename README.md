# UdacityND-Wine
## Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree/Exploratory Data Analysis

This is a project from the Udacity Analyst Nanodegree program. The goal of the project is to cover basic skills in exploratory data analysis, including basic data manipulation and data exploration using Pandas and NumPy, and data visualization using Matplotlib.

This project was developed in 2020 during the Nanodegree and it is no longer maintained. 

## About
This project explores the relationship between the quality of wine and its chemical properties (e.g. acidity, residual sugar, pH). The dataset comprises 6497 wines from a 2 datasets on red wine and white wine, and 13 variables, 12 of which describe the properties of the wine , and 1 of which is the quality rating of the wine. 

## Tech Stack
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows

### Datasets
winequality-red.csv - raw data set on red wine
winequality-white.csv - raw data set on white wine
winequality_edited.csv - processed data set combining red and white wine data

### Jupyter Notebooks
 appending-solutions.ipynb - python code to process the data and derive winequality_edited.csv which serves as the base data set for the project 
 conclusions_query_solution.ipynb - various queries to understand the relationship between the variables
 eda_visuals_solutions.ipynb- various visualizations of the processed data set
